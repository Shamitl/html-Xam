<h1> The Best Movies According to Sham </h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies that have been released in 2023 </h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Oppenhaimer</h3>
 <p>This is a really cool movie that I loved to watch. At first sight you might think that is boring because
    the characters are only talking and talking, but belive me when I tell you that the thinks that they are
    saying are really interisting. Its about How we humans created the bomb that might end us. The atomic bomb
    Learning the process, the consecuences and feelings that the people of that time felt, are really well made
    to the point that it gives you chills, and thats because the soundtrack is one of the best in movie history.
    So dont miss this movie because is part of our history
 </p>

 <h3>Spieder-man Across The Spider-verse</h3>
 <p>This movie is the sequel of the Oscar Winner Spiderman into the spiderverse. It tells the story of how Miles 
    being the  new spider man in town has to deal with an interdimensional villain called The Spot while dealing 
    with the spidermans from other Universes.
 </p>
 <p>Its a really funny movie that makes you lough like only spirderman can do, but at the same time it is really 
    serious with the problems that the main character has to deal with. The soundtrack helps the movie to transmit 
    those feelings that the movie wants you to have. And of course the great animation and the art style makes this
    film easy and interesting to watch
 </p>
 <h3>Gran Turismo</h3>
 <p>Yes, I know, How can you make a movie from a racing game with no story?<br />
    Well how about telling a real life story of a gamer boy who's dream is to become a profesional racer. This movie
    tells the story of a boy who is good at Gran Turismo and gets peeked to earn the chance to race for Nissan as a 
    professional racer.
 </p>
 <p> The story is really well told. And the script is interesting but what makes the movie really entertaining are 
    the actors, Orlando Bloom and the guy from Stranger Things. They make you feel what they are feelling across the 
    screen and not a lot of actors can do that, you can feel the emotion, the exaitment and the fear that a car race
    can give you.
